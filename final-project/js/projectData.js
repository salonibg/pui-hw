However, when they do get this suggestion, how do they note it down and later find it when it comes time to actual watch a tv show/movie? The truth is people often just note these recommendations down in their notes and forget about it or simply try to remember it. Our app brings a solution to this problem space by providing a centralized and simple location to track all your recommendations."

Currently, ResMed is operated fully online and thus requires customers to chose products from their online store. However, many first people that have been recently diagnosed with sleep apnea lack the knowledge to determine which mask or machine is right for them. ResFit solves this problem exactly. ResFit uses facial recognition technology to help users determine which mask is right for them and then gives them the opportunity to try it out."
