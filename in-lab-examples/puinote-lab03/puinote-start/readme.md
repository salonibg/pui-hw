# Lab Exercise 3

## Introduction

In this lab exercise, we will:
- Create a JavaScript object to represent a "notecard" in our app
- Access HTML elements using `document.querySelector`
- Read and modify the properties of HTML elements
- Write a function that runs when a user clicks on an element (i.e. a "submit" button, in our notes app)
