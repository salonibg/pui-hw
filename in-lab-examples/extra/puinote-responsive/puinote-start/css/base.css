/* ---------- CONTAINER ----------------------------------------------------- */

    easier to implement, since we can resize the container and many of the
    child elements will adapt automatically. In our design, the header and
    footer are both children of the #container div, though this is not always
    the case in practice (some web designers choose to have these elements
    outside of the container).

    top of the screen. */

    up, the notecards will be hidden behind this header div. (With no background
    color, the background would be transparent and we would see the notecards.)

    'Roboto Mono'. (This is a font from Google Fonts, which we include in
    index.html.) If 'Roboto Mono' can't be retrieved, the browswer will try
    to 'Courier New'. If that fails, it will use the default monospace font.
